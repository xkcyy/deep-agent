# LangSmith Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your LangChain agent to production, LangSmith provides a managed hosting platform designed for agent workloads. Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications, while LangGraph is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution. LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy directly from your repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

## Deploy your agent

### 1. Create a repository on GitHub

Your application's code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the [local server setup guide](/oss/python/langchain/studio#setup-local-agent-server). Then, push your code to the repository.

### 2. Deploy to LangSmith

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to LangSmith Deployments">
    Log in to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). In the left sidebar, select **Deployments**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new deployment">
    Click the **+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link repository">
    If you are a first time user or adding a private repository that has not been previously connected, click the **Add new account** button and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy repository">
    Select your application's repository. Click **Submit** to deploy. This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Test your application in Studio

Once your application is deployed:

1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.
2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. Studio will open to display your graph.

### 4. Get the API URL for your deployment

1. In the **Deployment details** view in LangGraph, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.
2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.

### 5. Test the API

You can now test the API:

  <Tab title="Python">
    1. Install LangGraph Python:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    pip install langgraph-sdk
    ```

    2. Send a message to the agent:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client # or get_client for async

    client = get_sync_client(url="your-deployment-url", api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")

    for chunk in client.runs.stream(
        None,    # Threadless run
        "agent", # Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.
        input={
            "messages": [{
                "role": "human",
                "content": "What is LangGraph?",
            }],
        },
        stream_mode="updates",
    ):
        print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
        print(chunk.data)
        print("\n\n")
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Rest API">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl -s --request POST \
        --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/runs/stream \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header "X-Api-Key: <LANGSMITH API KEY> \
        --data "{
            \"assistant_id\": \"agent\", `# Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.`
            \"input\": {
                \"messages\": [
                    {
                        \"role\": \"human\",
                        \"content\": \"What is LangGraph?\"
                    }
                ]
            },
            \"stream_mode\": \"updates\"
        }"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  LangSmith offers additional hosting options, including self-hosted and hybrid. For more information, please see the [Platform setup overview](/langsmith/platform-setup).
