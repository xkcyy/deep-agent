# Quickstart

This quickstart takes you from a simple setup to a fully functional AI agent in just a few minutes.

## Requirements

For these examples, you will need to:

* [Install](/oss/python/langchain/install) the LangChain package
* Set up a [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/) account and get an API key
* Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal

<Tip>
  **LangChain Docs MCP server**

  If you're using an AI coding assistant, you should install the [LangChain Docs MCP server](/use-these-docs) to get the most out of it. This ensures your agent has access to the latest documentation and examples.
</Tip>

## Build a basic agent

Start by creating a simple agent that can answer questions and call tools. The agent will use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its language model, a basic weather function as a tool, and a simple prompt to guide its behavior.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    tools=[get_weather],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```

<Tip>
  To learn how to trace your agent with LangSmith, see the [LangSmith documentation](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain).
</Tip>

## Build a real-world agent

Next, build a practical weather forecasting agent that demonstrates key production concepts:

1. **Detailed system prompts** for better agent behavior
2. **Create tools** that integrate with external data
3. **Model configuration** for consistent responses
4. **Structured output** for predictable results
5. **Conversational memory** for chat-like interactions
6. **Create and run the agent** create a fully functional agent

Let's walk through each step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the system prompt">
    The system prompt defines your agent’s role and behavior. Keep it specific and actionable:

    ```python wrap theme={null}
    SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

    You have access to two tools:

    - get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
    - get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

    If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean wherever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create tools">
    [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) let a model interact with external systems by calling functions you define.
    Tools can depend on [runtime context](/oss/python/langchain/runtime) and also interact with [agent memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory).

    Notice below how the `get_user_location` tool uses runtime context:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime

    @tool
    def get_weather_for_location(city: str) -> str:
        """Get weather for a given city."""
        return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

    @dataclass
    class Context:
        """Custom runtime context schema."""
        user_id: str

    @tool
    def get_user_location(runtime: ToolRuntime[Context]) -> str:
        """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
        user_id = runtime.context.user_id
        return "Florida" if user_id == "1" else "SF"
    ```

    <Tip>
      Tools should be well-documented: their name, description, and argument names become part of the model's prompt.
      LangChain's [`@tool` decorator](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/tools/#langchain.tools.tool) adds metadata and enables runtime injection via the `ToolRuntime` parameter.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your model">
    Set up your [language model](/oss/python/langchain/models) with the right parameters for your use case:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

    model = init_chat_model(
        "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        temperature=0.5,
        timeout=10,
        max_tokens=1000
    )
    ```

    Depending on the model and provider chosen, initialization parameters may vary; refer to their reference pages for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define response format">
    Optionally, define a structured response format if you need the agent responses to match
    a specific schema.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    # We use a dataclass here, but Pydantic models are also supported.
    @dataclass
    class ResponseFormat:
        """Response schema for the agent."""
        # A punny response (always required)
        punny_response: str
        # Any interesting information about the weather if available
        weather_conditions: str | None = None
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add memory">
    Add [memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) to your agent to maintain state across interactions. This allows
    the agent to remember previous conversations and context.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

    checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
    ```

    <Info>
      In production, use a persistent checkpointer that saves to a database.
      See [Add and manage memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#manage-short-term-memory) for more details.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and run the agent">
    Now assemble your agent with all the components and run it!

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy

    agent = create_agent(
        model=model,
        system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        tools=[get_user_location, get_weather_for_location],
        context_schema=Context,
        response_format=ToolStrategy(ResponseFormat),
        checkpointer=checkpointer
    )

    # `thread_id` is a unique identifier for a given conversation.
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

    response = agent.invoke(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
        config=config,
        context=Context(user_id="1")
    )

    print(response['structured_response'])
    # ResponseFormat(
    #     punny_response="Florida is still having a 'sun-derful' day! The sunshine is playing 'ray-dio' hits all day long! I'd say it's the perfect weather for some 'solar-bration'! If you were hoping for rain, I'm afraid that idea is all 'washed up' - the forecast remains 'clear-ly' brilliant!",
    #     weather_conditions="It's always sunny in Florida!"
    # )


    # Note that we can continue the conversation using the same `thread_id`.
    response = agent.invoke(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
        config=config,
        context=Context(user_id="1")
    )

    print(response['structured_response'])
    # ResponseFormat(
    #     punny_response="You're 'thund-erfully' welcome! It's always a 'breeze' to help you stay 'current' with the weather. I'm just 'cloud'-ing around waiting to 'shower' you with more forecasts whenever you need them. Have a 'sun-sational' day in the Florida sunshine!",
    #     weather_conditions=None
    # )
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
