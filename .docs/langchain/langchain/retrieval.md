# Retrieval

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they have two key limitations:

* **Finite context** — they can’t ingest entire corpora at once.
* **Static knowledge** — their training data is frozen at a point in time.

Retrieval addresses these problems by fetching relevant external knowledge at query time. This is the foundation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: enhancing an LLM’s answers with context-specific information.

## Building a knowledge base

A **knowledge base** is a repository of documents or structured data used during retrieval.

If you need a custom knowledge base, you can use LangChain’s document loaders and vector stores to build one from your own data.

<Note>
  If you already have a knowledge base (e.g., a SQL database, CRM, or internal documentation system), you do **not** need to rebuild it. You can:

  * Connect it as a **tool** for an agent in Agentic RAG.
  * Query it and supply the retrieved content as context to the LLM [(2-Step RAG)](#2-step-rag).
</Note>

See the following tutorial to build a searchable knowledge base and minimal RAG workflow:

### From retrieval to RAG

Retrieval allows LLMs to access relevant context at runtime. But most real-world applications go one step further: they **integrate retrieval with generation** to produce grounded, context-aware answers.

This is the core idea behind **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The retrieval pipeline becomes a foundation for a broader system that combines search with generation.

### Retrieval Pipeline

A typical retrieval workflow looks like this:

```mermaid  theme={null}
flowchart LR
  S(["Sources<br>(Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.)"]) --> L[Document Loaders]
  L --> A([Documents])
  A --> B[Split into chunks]
  B --> C[Turn into embeddings]
  C --> D[(Vector Store)]
  Q([User Query]) --> E[Query embedding]
  E --> D
  D --> F[Retriever]
  F --> G[LLM uses retrieved info]
  G --> H([Answer])
```

Each component is modular: you can swap loaders, splitters, embeddings, or vector stores without rewriting the app’s logic.

## RAG Architectures

RAG can be implemented in multiple ways, depending on your system's needs. We outline each type in the sections below.

| Architecture    | Description                                                                | Control   | Flexibility | Latency    | Example Use Case                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **2-Step RAG**  | Retrieval always happens before generation. Simple and predictable         | ✅ High    | ❌ Low       | ⚡ Fast     | FAQs, documentation bots                          |
| **Agentic RAG** | An LLM-powered agent decides *when* and *how* to retrieve during reasoning | ❌ Low     | ✅ High      | ⏳ Variable | Research assistants with access to multiple tools |
| **Hybrid**      | Combines characteristics of both approaches with validation steps          | ⚖️ Medium | ⚖️ Medium   | ⏳ Variable | Domain-specific Q\&A with quality validation      |

<Info>
  **Latency**: Latency is generally more **predictable** in **2-Step RAG**, as the maximum number of LLM calls is known and capped. This predictability assumes that LLM inference time is the dominant factor. However, real-world latency may also be affected by the performance of retrieval steps—such as API response times, network delays, or database queries—which can vary based on the tools and infrastructure in use.
</Info>

### 2-step RAG

In **2-Step RAG**, the retrieval step is always executed before the generation step. This architecture is straightforward and predictable, making it suitable for many applications where the retrieval of relevant documents is a clear prerequisite for generating an answer.

```mermaid  theme={null}
graph LR
    A[User Question] --> B["Retrieve Relevant Documents"]
    B --> C["Generate Answer"]
    C --> D[Return Answer to User]

### Agentic RAG

**Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the strengths of Retrieval-Augmented Generation with agent-based reasoning. Instead of retrieving documents before answering, an agent (powered by an LLM) reasons step-by-step and decides **when** and **how** to retrieve information during the interaction.

<Tip>
  The only thing an agent needs to enable RAG behavior is access to one or more **tools** that can fetch external knowledge — such as documentation loaders, web APIs, or database queries.

graph LR
    A[User Input / Question] --> B["Agent (LLM)"]
    B --> C{Need external info?}
    C -- Yes --> D["Search using tool(s)"]
    D --> H{Enough to answer?}
    H -- No --> B
    H -- Yes --> I[Generate final answer]
    C -- No --> I
    I --> J[Return to user]

  Your primary role is to help users with questions about LangGraph and related tools.

  Instructions:

  1. If a user asks a question you're unsure about — or one that likely involves API usage,

  2. When citing documentation, summarize clearly and include relevant context from the content.
  3. Do not use any URLs outside of the allowed domain.
  4. If a documentation fetch fails, tell the user and proceed with your best expert understanding.

  You can access official documentation from the following approved sources:

### Hybrid RAG

Hybrid RAG combines characteristics of both 2-Step and Agentic RAG. It introduces intermediate steps such as query preprocessing, retrieval validation, and post-generation checks. These systems offer more flexibility than fixed pipelines while maintaining some control over execution.

Typical components include:

* **Query enhancement**: Modify the input question to improve retrieval quality. This can involve rewriting unclear queries, generating multiple variations, or expanding queries with additional context.
* **Retrieval validation**: Evaluate whether retrieved documents are relevant and sufficient. If not, the system may refine the query and retrieve again.
* **Answer validation**: Check the generated answer for accuracy, completeness, and alignment with source content. If needed, the system can regenerate or revise the answer.

The architecture often supports multiple iterations between these steps:

```mermaid  theme={null}
graph LR
    A[User Question] --> B[Query Enhancement]
    B --> C[Retrieve Documents]
    C --> D{Sufficient Info?}
    D -- No --> E[Refine Query]
    E --> C
    D -- Yes --> F[Generate Answer]
    F --> G{Answer Quality OK?}
    G -- No --> H{Try Different Approach?}
    H -- Yes --> E
    H -- No --> I[Return Best Answer]
    G -- Yes --> I
    I --> J[Return to User]

    class A,J startend
    class B,C,E,F,I process
    class D,G,H decision
```

* Applications with ambiguous or underspecified queries
* Systems that require validation or quality control steps
* Workflows involving multiple sources or iterative refinement
