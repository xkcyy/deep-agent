# Dropbox

[Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox) is a file hosting service that brings everything-traditional files, cloud content, and web shortcuts together in one place.

This notebook covers how to load documents from *Dropbox*. In addition to common files such as text and PDF files, it also supports *Dropbox Paper* files.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Dropbox app.
2. Give the app these scope permissions: `files.metadata.read` and `files.content.read`.
3. Generate access token: [www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create).
4. `pip install dropbox` (requires `pip install "unstructured[pdf]"` for PDF filetype).

## Instructions

\`DropboxLoader\`\` requires you to create a Dropbox App and generate an access token. This can be done from [www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create). You also need to have the Dropbox Python SDK installed (pip install dropbox).

DropboxLoader can load data from a list of Dropbox file paths or a single Dropbox folder path. Both paths should be relative to the root directory of the Dropbox account linked to the access token.

```python  theme={null}
pip install dropbox
```

```python  theme={null}
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DropboxLoader
```

```python  theme={null}
# Generate access token: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create.
dropbox_access_token = "<DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
# Dropbox root folder
dropbox_folder_path = ""
```

```python  theme={null}
loader = DropboxLoader(
    dropbox_access_token=dropbox_access_token,
    dropbox_folder_path=dropbox_folder_path,
    recursive=False,
)
```

```python  theme={null}
documents = loader.load()
```

```output  theme={null}
File /JHSfLKn0.jpeg could not be decoded as text. Skipping.
File /A REPORT ON WILES’ CAMBRIDGE LECTURES.pdf could not be decoded as text. Skipping.
```

```python  theme={null}
for document in documents:
    print(document)
```
