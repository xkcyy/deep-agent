# Oracle AI Vector Search - Vector Store

Oracle AI Vector Search is designed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads that allows you to query data based on semantics, rather than keywords.
One of the biggest benefits of Oracle AI Vector Search is that semantic search on unstructured data can be combined with relational search on business data in one single system.
This is not only powerful but also significantly more effective because you don't need to add a specialized vector database, eliminating the pain of data fragmentation between multiple systems.

In addition, your vectors can benefit from all of Oracle Database’s most powerful features, like the following:

* [Partitioning Support](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/partitioning.html)
* [Real Application Clusters scalability](https://www.oracle.com/database/real-application-clusters/)
* [Exadata smart scans](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/exadata/software/smartscan/)
* [Shard processing across geographically distributed databases](https://www.oracle.com/database/distributed-database/)
* [Transactions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/transactions.html)
* [Parallel SQL](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/vldbg/parallel-exec-intro.html#GUID-D28717E4-0F77-44F5-BB4E-234C31D4E4BA)

If you are just starting with Oracle Database, consider exploring the [free Oracle 23 AI](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/#resources) which provides a great introduction to setting up your database environment. While working with the database, it is often advisable to avoid using the system user by default; instead, you can create your own user for enhanced security and customization. For detailed steps on user creation, refer to our [end-to-end guide](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/v0.3/cookbook/oracleai_demo.ipynb) which also shows how to set up a user in Oracle. Additionally, understanding user privileges is crucial for managing database security effectively. You can learn more about this topic in the official [Oracle guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admqs/administering-user-accounts-and-security.html#GUID-36B21D72-1BBB-46C9-A0C9-F0D2A8591B8D) on administering user accounts and security.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install `langchain-oracledb` to use this integration.

The `python-oracledb` driver is installed automatically as a dependency of langchain-oracledb.

```python  theme={null}
# python -m pip install -U langchain-oracledb
```

### Connect to Oracle AI Vector Search

The following sample code will show how to connect to Oracle Database. By default, python-oracledb runs in a ‘Thin’ mode which connects directly to Oracle Database. This mode does not need Oracle Client libraries. However, some additional functionality is available when python-oracledb uses them. Python-oracledb is said to be in ‘Thick’ mode when Oracle Client libraries are used. Both modes have comprehensive functionality supporting the Python Database API v2.0 Specification. See the following [guide](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/appendix_a.html#featuresummary) that talks about features supported in each mode. You might want to switch to thick-mode if you are unable to use thin-mode.

```python  theme={null}
import oracledb

# Please update with your username, password, hostname, port and service_name
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"
dsn = "<hostname>:<port>/<service_name>"

connection = oracledb.connect(user=username, password=password, dsn=dsn)
print("Connection successful!")
```

### Import the required dependencies

```python  theme={null}
from langchain_oracledb.vectorstores import oraclevs
from langchain_oracledb.vectorstores.oraclevs import OracleVS
from langchain_community.vectorstores.utils import DistanceStrategy
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
```

### Load documents

```python  theme={null}
# Define a list of documents (The examples below are 5 random documents from Oracle Concepts Manual )

documents_json_list = [
    {
        "id": "cncpt_15.5.3.2.2_P4",
        "text": "If the answer to any preceding questions is yes, then the database stops the search and allocates space from the specified tablespace; otherwise, space is allocated from the database default shared temporary tablespace.",
        "link": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/logical-storage-structures.html#GUID-5387D7B2-C0CA-4C1E-811B-C7EB9B636442",
    },
    {
        "id": "cncpt_15.5.5_P1",
        "text": "A tablespace can be online (accessible) or offline (not accessible) whenever the database is open.\nA tablespace is usually online so that its data is available to users. The SYSTEM tablespace and temporary tablespaces cannot be taken offline.",
        "link": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/logical-storage-structures.html#GUID-D02B2220-E6F5-40D9-AFB5-BC69BCEF6CD4",
    },
    {
        "id": "cncpt_22.3.4.3.1_P2",
        "text": "The database stores LOBs differently from other data types. Creating a LOB column implicitly creates a LOB segment and a LOB index. The tablespace containing the LOB segment and LOB index, which are always stored together, may be different from the tablespace containing the table.\nSometimes the database can store small amounts of LOB data in the table itself rather than in a separate LOB segment.",
        "link": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/concepts-for-database-developers.html#GUID-3C50EAB8-FC39-4BB3-B680-4EACCE49E866",
    },
    {
        "id": "cncpt_22.3.4.3.1_P3",
        "text": "The LOB segment stores data in pieces called chunks. A chunk is a logically contiguous set of data blocks and is the smallest unit of allocation for a LOB. A row in the table stores a pointer called a LOB locator, which points to the LOB index. When the table is queried, the database uses the LOB index to quickly locate the LOB chunks.",
        "link": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/concepts-for-database-developers.html#GUID-3C50EAB8-FC39-4BB3-B680-4EACCE49E866",
    },
]
```

```python  theme={null}
# Create LangChain Documents

documents_langchain = []

for doc in documents_json_list:
    metadata = {"id": doc["id"], "link": doc["link"]}
    doc_langchain = Document(page_content=doc["text"], metadata=metadata)
    documents_langchain.append(doc_langchain)
```

### Create vector stores with different distance metrics

First we will create three vector stores each with different distance functions. Since we have not created indices in them yet, they will just create tables for now. Later we will use these vector stores to create HNSW indicies. To understand more about the different types of indices Oracle AI Vector Search supports, refer to the following [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/vecse/manage-different-categories-vector-indexes.html) .

You can manually connect to the Oracle Database and will see three tables :
Documents\_DOT, Documents\_COSINE and Documents\_EUCLIDEAN.

We will then create three additional tables Documents\_DOT\_IVF, Documents\_COSINE\_IVF and Documents\_EUCLIDEAN\_IVF which will be used
to create IVF indicies on the tables instead of HNSW indices.

```python  theme={null}
# Ingest documents into Oracle Vector Store using different distance strategies

# When using our API calls, start by initializing your vector store with a subset of your documents
# through from_documents(), then incrementally add more documents using add_texts().
# This approach prevents system overload and ensures efficient document processing.

model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")

vector_store_dot = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_DOT",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.DOT_PRODUCT,
)
vector_store_max = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_COSINE",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,
)
vector_store_euclidean = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_EUCLIDEAN",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE,
)

# Ingest documents into Oracle Vector Store using different distance strategies
vector_store_dot_ivf = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_DOT_IVF",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.DOT_PRODUCT,
)
vector_store_max_ivf = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_COSINE_IVF",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,
)
vector_store_euclidean_ivf = OracleVS.from_documents(
    documents_langchain,
    model,
    client=connection,
    table_name="Documents_EUCLIDEAN_IVF",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE,
)
```

### Add and delete operations for texts, along with basic similarity search

```python  theme={null}

### Advanced search

Oracle Database 23ai supports pre-filtering, in-filtering, and post-filtering to enhance AI Vector Search capabilities. These filtering mechanisms allow users to apply constraints before, during, and after performing vector similarity searches, improving search performance and accuracy.

Key Points about Filtering in Oracle 23ai:

1. Pre-filtering
   Applies traditional SQL filters to reduce the dataset before performing the vector similarity search.
   Helps improve efficiency by limiting the amount of data processed by AI algorithms.
2. In-filtering
   Utilizes AI Vector Search to perform similarity searches directly on vector embeddings, using optimized indexes and algorithms.
   Efficiently filters results based on vector similarity without requiring full dataset scans.
3. Post-filtering
   Applies additional SQL filtering to refine the results after the vector similarity search.
   Allows further refinement based on business logic or additional metadata conditions.

**Why is this Important?**

* Performance Optimization: Pre-filtering significantly reduces query execution time, making searches on massive datasets more efficient.
* Accuracy Enhancement: In-filtering ensures that vector searches are semantically meaningful, improving the quality of search results.

#### Filter Details

`OracleVS` supports a set of filters that can be applied to `metadata` fields using `filter` parameter. These filters allow you to select and refine data based on various criteria.

**Available Filter Operators:**

| Operator         | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\$exists`       | Field exists.                                                                                               |
| `\$eq`           | Field value equals the operand value (`=`).                                                                 |
| `\$ne`           | Field exists and value does not equal the operand value (`!=`).                                             |
| `\$gt`           | Field value is greater than the operand value (`>`).                                                        |
| `\$lt`           | Field value is less than the operand value (`<`).                                                           |
| `\$gte`          | Field value is greater than or equal to the operand value (`>=`).                                           |
| `\$lte`          | Field value is less than or equal to the operand value (`<=`).                                              |
| `\$between`      | Field value is between (or equal to) two values in the operand array.                                       |
| `\$startsWith`   | Field value starts with the operand value.                                                                  |
| `\$hasSubstring` | Field value contains the operand as a substring.                                                            |
| `\$instr`        | Field value contains the operand as a substring.                                                            |
| `\$regex`        | Field value matches the given regular expression pattern.                                                   |
| `\$like`         | Field value matches the operand pattern (using SQL-like syntax).                                            |
| `\$in`           | Field value equals at least one value in the operand array.                                                 |
| `\$nin`          | Field exists, but its value is not equal to any in the operand array, or the field does not exist.          |
| `\$all`          | Field value is an array containing all items from the operand array, or a scalar matching a single operand. |

* You can combine these filters using logical operators:

| Logical Operator | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `\$and`          | Logical AND |
| `\$or`           | Logical OR  |
| `\$nor`          | Logical NOR |

**Example Filter:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "age": 65,
  "name": {"$regex": "*rk"},
  "$or": [
    {
      "$and": [
        {"name": "Jason"},
        {"drinks": {"$in": ["tea", "soda"]}}
      ]
    },
    {
      "$nor": [
        {"age": {"$lt": 65}},
        {"name": "Jason"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Additional Usage Tips:**

* You can omit `$and` when all filters in an object must be satisfied. These two are equivalent:

```json  theme={null}
{ "$and": [
    { "name": { "$startsWith": "Fred" } },
    { "salary": { "$gt": 10000, "$lte": 20000 } }
]}
```

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": { "$startsWith": "Fred" },
  "salary": { "$gt": 10000, "$lte": 20000 }
}
```

* The `$not` clause can negate a comparison operator:

```json  theme={null}
{ "address.zip": { "$not": { "$eq": "90001" } } }
```

* Using `field: scalar` is equivalent to `field: { "$eq": scalar }`:

```json  theme={null}
{ "animal": "cat" }
```

For more filter examples, refer to the [test specification](https://github.com/oracle/langchain-oracle/blob/main/libs/oracledb/tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_oraclevs.py).
